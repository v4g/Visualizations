How do you connect two ellipses?
    If you choose a point on A, it has a corresponding point on B (where velocities match) 4 point interpolation
    Could we make more ellipses arise from the path? 
    How do we select the first point on A?
    How do we decide where to place the ellipses?
    The path to the 3rd ellipse cannot cross the path between A and B
