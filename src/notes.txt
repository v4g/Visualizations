How do you connect two ellipses?
    If you choose a point on A, it has a corresponding point on B (where velocities match) 4 point interpolation
    Could we make more ellipses arise from the path? 
    How do we select the first point on A?
    How do we decide where to place the ellipses?
    The path to the 3rd ellipse cannot cross the path between A and B

Change ellipses into spirals (parameter u - {0,1}, takes a,b from 0,0 to a,b, and theta, number of rotations = r 
                theta = u * r * 2PI)

Find the right point for the spirals to interpolate into. the right, the easiest path.
I have a list of candidate u's that this can be sent to, how to choose the best one? The other ones would require very sharp acceleration
Find the curve with the smallest possible acceleration. How do you find the right velocity and the right point to go to. Shortest path between which points
The destinations are the two spirals. Every point on them is a destination
The first point that is in between both the spirals is the point to start at, in the direction of the other guy, ditto for the opposite
    -  the velocity will be in the direction (AB) a = spiral1, b = spiral2
    - find the point with this velocity
    - the other velocity will be the same, find the point with this velocity, connect them
    - DONE

Arrange the spirals 
    - Select two spirals to connect, close to each other such that the connection does not intersect other spirals
    - Intersection test of the curve with other spirals will be expensive
    - Place the spirals some distance away from each other

    - Partition the space into squares, then connect neighbors

    - Lay them out in a grid

STATIC SPIRALS - 
    The connection goes into one spiral and comes out of a rotated version of the spiral connecting to a third one. Every spiral rotation has only one connection
